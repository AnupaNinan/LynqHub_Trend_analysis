By transforming raw data into actionable intelligence, the project aims to:

- Improve operational efficiency
- Enable data-driven decision-making
- Optimize business processes
- Enhance customer experience on a global scale </details>

1. What were the overall sales trends from 2019 to 2022?
2. What were the company's yearly and monthly growth rates?

<p><b>LynqHub Performance (2018â€“2022)</b></p>

<p>
LynqHub recorded a strong upward trajectory from <b>2018 through early 2020</b>, achieving <b>total sales of approximately $26 million</b> and processing over <b>102,000 orders</b> across the five-year period. 
The companyâ€™s <b>average order value (AOV)</b> over this timeframe stood at roughly <b>$255 per order</b>, underscoring consistent purchasing behavior and healthy transaction sizes.
</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>Pandemic-Driven Peak (2019â€“2020)</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Between 2018 and early 2020, order volume <b>nearly doubled (+95%)</b>, indicating rapid expansion and sustained demand growth.</li>
      <li>This surge in orders <b>propelled sales growth of over 50% year-over-year</b>, marking one of the companyâ€™s strongest upward trends to date.</li>
      <li>In <b>2020</b>, LynqHub reached its <b>highest performance point</b>, with <b>sales exceeding $9 million</b>, driven by surging demand and an expanding online customer base.</li>
      <li>The <b>average order value (AOV)</b> peaked at approximately <b>$275</b>, reflecting a shift toward higher-value products and stronger digital conversions during the pandemic period.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Post-2020 Decline and Market Stabilization</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Following the <b>2020 peak</b>, LynqHubâ€™s <b>sales momentum weakened</b>, signaling the start of a downward trend after a period of exceptional growth.</li>
      <li><b>Total revenue declined by about 15% in 2021</b> and fell even more sharplyâ€”<b>by approximately 45â€“50% in 2022</b>â€”bringing yearly sales down to nearly <b>$4.5 million</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Order count mirrored this decline</b>, dropping by <b>more than half (âˆ’55%)</b> compared to its 2020 high, underscoring a broad contraction in customer demand.</li>
      <li>The <b>average order value (AOV)</b> decreased moderately, stabilizing around <b>$240â€“$250 per order</b>, suggesting that the downturn was primarily <b>volume-driven rather than pricing-related</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li><b>Key Insights & Opportunities</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li><b>Sustained Customer Engagement:</b> The sharp decline after 2020 suggests a <b>pandemic demand bubble</b>. Building <b>retention programs</b> and <b>reactivating the 2020 cohort</b> could recover up to <b>30â€“35% of lost orders</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Product Mix Optimization:</b> With <b>AOV holding steady</b>, thereâ€™s potential to emphasize <b>higher-margin products</b> without reducing order frequency.</li>
      <li><b>Seasonal Campaign Leverage:</b> <b>Quarter 4 spikes</b> in both <b>2020 and 2021</b> highlight a recurring <b>end-of-year demand opportunity</b> that can be strategically amplified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
