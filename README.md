By transforming raw data into actionable intelligence, the project aims to:

- Improve operational efficiency
- Enable data-driven decision-making
- Optimize business processes
- Enhance customer experience on a global scale </details>

<img width="1263" height="709" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fdcb7d5-5683-4e7b-9ac9-dbbe050e80c6" />


<p><b>LynqHub Performance (2018â€“2022)</b></p>

<p>
LynqHub recorded a strong upward trajectory from <b>2018 through early 2020</b>, achieving <b>total sales of approximately $26 million</b> and processing over <b>102,000 orders</b> across the five-year period. 
The companyâ€™s <b>average order value (AOV)</b> over this timeframe stood at roughly <b>$255 per order</b>, underscoring consistent purchasing behavior and healthy transaction sizes.
</p>


<ul>
  <li><b>Pandemic-Driven Peak (2019â€“2020)</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Between 2018 and early 2020, order volume <b>nearly doubled (+95%)</b>, indicating rapid expansion and sustained demand growth.</li>
      <li>This surge in orders <b>propelled sales growth of over 50% year-over-year</b>, marking one of the companyâ€™s strongest upward trends to date.</li>
      <li>In <b>2020</b>, LynqHub reached its <b>highest performance point</b>, with <b>sales exceeding $9 million</b>, driven by surging demand and an expanding online customer base.</li>
      <li>The <b>average order value (AOV)</b> peaked at approximately <b>$275</b>, reflecting a shift toward higher-value products and stronger digital conversions during the pandemic period.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>Post-2020 Decline and Market Stabilization</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li>Following the <b>2020 peak</b>, LynqHubâ€™s <b>sales momentum weakened</b>, signaling the start of a downward trend after a period of exceptional growth.</li>
      <li><b>Total revenue declined by about 15% in 2021</b> and fell even more sharplyâ€”<b>by approximately 45â€“50% in 2022</b>â€”bringing yearly sales down to nearly <b>$4.5 million</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Order count mirrored this decline</b>, dropping by <b>more than half (âˆ’55%)</b> compared to its 2020 high, underscoring a broad contraction in customer demand.</li>
      <li>The <b>average order value (AOV)</b> decreased moderately, stabilizing around <b>$240â€“$250 per order</b>, suggesting that the downturn was primarily <b>volume-driven rather than pricing-related</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>


<ul>
  <li><b>Key Insights & Opportunities</b>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
      <li><b>Sustained Customer Engagement:</b> The sharp decline after 2020 suggests a <b>pandemic demand bubble</b>. Building <b>retention programs</b> and <b>reactivating the 2020 cohort</b> could recover up to <b>30â€“35% of lost orders</b>.</li>
      <li><b>Product Mix Optimization:</b> With <b>AOV holding steady</b>, thereâ€™s potential to emphasize <b>higher-margin products</b> without reducing order frequency.</li>
      <li><b>Seasonal Campaign Leverage:</b> <b>Quarter 4 spikes</b> in both <b>2020 and 2021</b> highlight a recurring <b>end-of-year demand opportunity</b> that can be strategically amplified.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

</p>

<p><b>Total Sales â€“ Growth Insights</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Volatility & Peaks:</b> The Total Sales trend shows significant month-to-month volatility, especially between late <b>2019</b> and mid-<b>2020</b>, where growth peaked around <b>+50%</b>. These surges coincide with high-order months and likely reflect short-term demand spikes such as pandemic-related buying behavior.</li>
  <li><b>Sharp Declines:</b> Following each surge, sharp contractions of <b>âˆ’30% to âˆ’50%</b> indicate that sales are highly reactive to external demand triggers rather than driven by steady organic growth.</li>
  <li><b>Post-2021 Flattening:</b> After <b>2021</b>, growth rates stabilized below <b>+10%</b>, suggesting LynqHub entered a <b>plateau phase</b> with limited new customer acquisition or expansion opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Implement Predictive Demand Planning:</b> Use historical MoM data to forecast demand surges and optimize marketing and inventory cycles to reduce volatility.</li>
  <li><b>Diversify Product Portfolio:</b> Introduce new categories or complementary products to smooth out revenue fluctuations across months.</li>
  <li><b>Maintain Marketing Continuity:</b> Develop ongoing loyalty or subscription programs to promote consistent engagement and prevent post-peak drop-offs.</li>
</ul>

<br>

<p><b>Average Order Value (AOV) â€“ Growth Insights</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Moderate Fluctuations:</b> AOV shows smaller, more controlled swings ranging from <b>+18%</b> to <b>âˆ’16%</b>, reflecting relatively stable transaction values compared to total sales or order count.</li>
  <li><b>Seasonal Spikes:</b> Noticeable AOV increases of <b>10â€“18%</b> are likely tied to promotional or festive months, suggesting effective short-term upselling or premium product interest.</li>
  <li><b>Recent Downtrend:</b> The recent pattern shows more declines than gains, indicating a <b>gradual reduction in average spend per order</b>â€”possibly due to discount dependency or lower-priced product preferences.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Encourage Upselling & Bundling:</b> Create bundled offerings and value-based upgrades to lift average transaction values during regular months.</li>
  <li><b>Limit Excessive Discounting:</b> Replace heavy discounts with loyalty rewards or free-shipping thresholds to maintain AOV stability without margin erosion.</li>
  <li><b>Customer Segmentation:</b> Identify high-value customer segments and personalize campaigns to target premium buyers more effectively.</li>
</ul>

<br>
<p><b>Order Count â€“ Growth Insights</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Sharp Cyclical Movements:</b> The Order Count chart reveals frequent, steep MoM shifts with highs of <b>+40â€“45%</b> and lows reaching <b>âˆ’47%</b>, reflecting strong seasonal dependency or reliance on marketing campaigns.</li>
  <li><b>Pandemic Boom & Correction:</b> Early <b>2020</b> shows clear pandemic-driven growth, followed by consistent declines from <b>2021</b> onwardâ€”signaling a reversion to pre-pandemic purchasing levels.</li>
  <li><b>Recent Stabilization:</b> By <b>2022</b>, order count growth stabilized near zero, pointing to challenges in retaining customers and sustaining repeat purchases.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Strengthen Customer Retention:</b> Launch reactivation campaigns, loyalty points, and referral incentives to increase repeat purchases and mitigate churn.</li>
  <li><b>Boost Off-Season Engagement:</b> Use micro-campaigns and limited-time offers during slower months to maintain consistent order flow.</li>
  <li><b>Optimize Conversion Funnel:</b> Evaluate checkout and cart abandonment data to streamline the purchasing process and lift completion rates.</li>
</ul>
<br>

## Seasonal Trends
<p align="left">

       width="800" 
       height="260">
</p>

<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Strong Year-End and Fall Performance:</b> 
  <b>September</b> and <b>December</b> were the top-performing months, with sales surging <b>+13â€“23%</b> and order growth above <b>+10%</b>. These peaks align with back-to-school demand and the holiday shopping season, confirming clear <b>Q4 seasonality</b>.</li>

  <li><b>Mid-Year Slowdowns:</b> 
  <b>February</b> and <b>June</b> saw the weakest performance, with sales dropping <b>âˆ’9% to âˆ’25%</b> and orders down <b>âˆ’8% to âˆ’27%</b>. These troughs reflect post-holiday and mid-year lulls in consumer activity.</li>

  <li><b>High-Value Orders in Late Q3â€“Q4:</b> 
  Average Order Value (AOV) peaked between <b>Augustâ€“October</b> ($263â€“$272), suggesting stronger product mix or premium purchases during late-year campaigns, even when order counts dipped.</li>

  <li><b>Sharp Declines in October:</b> 
  Despite the highest AOV ($272), <b>October</b> saw total sales and orders fall by nearly <b>âˆ’28% to âˆ’29%</b>, highlighting over-reliance on fewer high-value transactions and missed pre-holiday conversion opportunities.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Recommendations:</b></p>
<ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
  <li><b>Leverage Q3â€“Q4 Peaks:</b> Begin marketing push from <b>August</b> onward to maximize back-to-school and holiday season growth.</li>
  <li><b>Address Low Months:</b> Run targeted promotions or loyalty rewards in <b>February</b> and <b>June</b> to stabilize post-holiday and mid-year dips.</li>
  <li><b>Boost October Retention:</b> Convert high AOV traffic into higher order counts via bundle discounts or limited-time campaigns.</li>
  <li><b>Maintain AOV Strength:</b> Continue emphasizing premium upsells and value-based bundles to sustain per-order profitability year-round.</li>
</ul>

## Product Trends

       alt="Product Trends" 
       width="1000" 
       height="500">
</p>
<ul>
  <li><b>Revenue Concentration Risk:</b> The top three products contribute the majority of total revenue, signaling a potential dependency on a limited product mix. Diversifying beyond high-performing categories could mitigate risk from market saturation or inventory shifts.</li>

  <li><b>Accessory-Driven Volume Growth:</b> Lower-priced accessories like <b>Samsung Cable Packs</b> and <b>Webcams</b> consistently deliver strong order counts, reinforcing their role as high-frequency, entry-level purchases that help sustain customer engagement and repeat transactions.</li>

  <li><b>Yearly Demand Cycles by Category:</b> Premium devices such as <b>MacBook Air</b> and <b>4K Monitors</b> show sharp year-over-year swings tied to upgrade or replacement cycles, while accessories maintain steadier sales. This contrast suggests opportunities for staggered promotion strategies to balance cyclical revenue dips.</li>

  <li><b>Brand Dominance and Ecosystem Synergy:</b> <b>Apple products</b> collectively command a large share of both high-value and high-volume segments, reflecting strong brand pull. Aligning marketing and bundling strategies around Appleâ€™s ecosystem (e.g., <b>AirPods + MacBook</b> packages) could amplify overall conversion rates.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li><b>North America (US & CA):</b> Accounts for <b>66% of total sales</b>, led by the <b>US (61%)</b> with an <b>AOV of $262</b>. This reflects LyncHubâ€™s strongest customer base and highest transaction volumes.</li>

  <li><b>Asia-Pacific (APAC):</b> Although smaller in sales volume, the region records the <b>highest AOV ($393 in Japan)</b>, suggesting fewer but more valuable transactions that could be expanded through targeted marketing.</li>

  <li><b>Latin America (LATAM):</b> Currently underdeveloped, contributing minimal revenue despite a <b>mid-range AOV of $251</b>. This signals <b>untapped growth potential</b> through regional partnerships and localized promotions.</li>
